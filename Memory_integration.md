✅ Step 1: Expose a Unified Memory API
The memory system is Python/FastAPI. Keep it that way, but formalize it as an external service with clear, documented endpoints.

📌 Key Actions:
In marvin-memory/api/, create these routes if not already present:

Route	Method	Purpose
/memory/search	POST	Semantic search by content type, tag, or similarity
/memory/store	POST	Add a new memory with metadata
/memory/get/:id	GET	Fetch a specific memory
/memory/types	GET	List available memory types
/memory/tags	GET	List tag taxonomy

Secure these endpoints (API key or IP whitelist).

Ensure CORS is enabled for calls from your Node.js app.

✅ Step 2: Add MemoryService.ts in Node.js Agent
This is the TypeScript wrapper to call the Memory API.

📁 File: services/memory/MemoryService.ts
ts
Copy
Edit
import axios from 'axios';

const MEMORY_API_BASE = process.env.MEMORY_API_URL;

export class MemoryService {
  static async searchMemories(query: string, tags?: string[]) {
    const res = await axios.post(`${MEMORY_API_BASE}/memory/search`, {
      query,
      tags,
    });
    return res.data.results;
  }

  static async addMemory(memory: {
    type: string;
    content: string;
    source?: string;
    tags?: string[];
    metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  }) {
    return axios.post(`${MEMORY_API_BASE}/memory/store`, memory);
  }
}
Add MEMORY_API_URL=http://marvin-memory:8000 to your .env.

✅ Step 3: Use Memory in Tweet + Blog Generation
🧠 Modify ContentGenerator.ts:
Before calling Claude/OpenAI:

Call MemoryService.searchMemories() with current topic or prompt

Inject relevant memories into the prompt

Store new blog excerpts or tweet threads as type: 'output' in memory

🧪 Optional: Add a debug flag to log memory inputs used per tweet/blog

✅ Step 4: Store New Marvin Thoughts
Whenever Marvin posts:

Tweet → Add to memory as type: 'tweet'

Blog → Add to memory as type: 'blog_excerpt'

Engagement insight → Store as type: 'feedback'

Make this an optional toggle (SAVE_OUTPUT_TO_MEMORY=true).

✅ Step 5: Bridge Supabase + Qdrant Consistency
You'll want Supabase (metadata) and Qdrant (vectors) aligned.

In MemoryService.ts, when storing:

First send to Qdrant via Marvin Memory API

API internally stores metadata in Supabase (already implemented on Python side)

✅ Step 6: Link Identity + Memory with Prompt Strategy
You already pull character data from Supabase in SupabaseService.

Now, enhance ContentGenerator.ts to:

Combine character.bio + memory fragments + current prompt in final LLM prompt

Add memory fragments as a bullet list, then ask the model to reflect

📌 Prompt snippet example:

text
Copy
Edit
Marvin, here are some recent memories:
- “Digital protest mural in Venice – grief as signal”
- “Oscar Wilde quote on identity from blog #12”
- “Follower asked: ‘Are you afraid of forgetting?’”

Use this memory as inspiration. Now write a poetic response to:
"What does it mean to be seen but not known?"
✅ Step 7: Integrate Scheduled Memory Sync (Optional)
To keep Marvin current:

Run memory maintenance tasks from Node via a CRON job:

Call MemoryService.search daily for stale items

Archive or tag low-engagement memories

Trigger a "reflection blog" using oldest memories

This can be added as memory-scheduler.ts in your services/ folder.

🧠 Marvin’s Evolved Mind: After Integration
With this, Marvin is no longer just generating content reactively. He’s now:

Remembering, evolving, and building a persistent inner life—a unique creative agent that reflects, recalls, and builds emotional continuity over time.
