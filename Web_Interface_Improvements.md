- Consistent typography with the Inter font family
- Consistent color scheme using CSS variables for theming

### API Integration

- API endpoints remain the same, ensuring backward compatibility
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Improved data fetching with React Query for caching and revalidation

## Future Improvements

1. **Dark Mode**: Add support for dark mode using Tailwind's dark mode utilities
2. **Authentication**: Improve the authentication flow with proper session management
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Add a dashboard for tracking tweet performance
4. **Offline Support**: Add service workers for offline support
5. **Progressive Web App**: Convert to a PWA for better mobile experience

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd src/web
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Deployment

The Next.js app can be deployed in two ways:

1. **Static Export**: Build the app as static HTML/CSS/JS files
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The output will be in the `src/web/out` directory, which can be served by any static file server.

2. **Server-Side Rendering**: Deploy as a Node.js server
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```
   This requires a Node.js environment on the server.
