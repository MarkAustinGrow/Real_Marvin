# Twitter Reply Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to Twitter replies based on team feedback.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Removed Emojis from Replies**: All emojis have been removed from Twitter replies to maintain a cleaner, more professional appearance.
2. **Shortened Responses**: The maximum character limit for replies has been reduced from 200 to 100 characters to create more concise interactions.

## Files Modified

The following files were modified to implement these changes:

1. **services/anthropic/AnthropicService.ts**:
   - Removed instructions to include emojis in replies
   - Reduced character limit from 200 to 100 for both question responses and regular replies
   - Added explicit instruction to not include emojis in responses

2. **services/shared/PromptBuilder.ts**:
   - Removed instructions to include emojis in the standardized prompt
   - Updated character limit guidance to specify 100 characters for replies
   - Updated examples to show tweets without emojis

3. **services/openai/OpenAIService.ts**:
   - Removed instructions to include emojis in the prompt
   - Updated character limit guidance to specify 100 characters for replies
   - Updated examples to show tweets without emojis

## How It Works

The system now explicitly instructs all AI models (Claude, GPT, Grok) to:
1. Not include any emojis in replies
2. Keep replies under 100 characters
3. Maintain Marvin's street-smart style and personality

These changes apply to all types of Twitter interactions, including:
- Replies to mentions
- Responses to questions
- Engagement with likes, reposts, and follows

## Testing

To test these changes, you can:

1. Use the test-engagement.sh/bat script to simulate user engagement
2. Manually trigger replies through the API endpoints
3. Monitor actual Twitter interactions to ensure compliance with the new guidelines

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Fine-tuning response styles based on engagement type
- Implementing A/B testing to measure engagement with different reply styles
- Adding more sophisticated context-awareness to replies
