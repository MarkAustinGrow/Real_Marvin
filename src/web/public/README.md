# Static Assets Directory

This directory is used for static assets that will be served by the Next.js application.

Examples of files you might place here:
- Images
- Fonts
- Favicon
- Robots.txt
- Manifest.json

Files in this directory will be served at the root path. For example, `/favicon.ico` will be served from `/public/favicon.ico`.
