🤖 Updated Engagement System with Grok for Humor
Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Same as Before)
1. ✅ Create engagement_metrics Table
Use the same schema to log likes, reposts, follows, and replies.

Phase 2: Logging & Detection
2. ✅ Build EngagementService
Log every engagement

Detect recurring fans

Track which tweets are resonating

Phase 3: Grok Integration for Humorous Responses
3. 🔌 Create GrokService Module
Connect to the Grok API (or placeholder if API access is limited)

Method: generateHumorousReply(context: string): Promise<string>

Example prompt:

ts
Copy
Edit
const systemPrompt = "You're Marvin, a snarky, poetic AI who responds with quirky humor and digital wit.";

const userPrompt = `Someone named @JochenPflesser just liked a tweet that says: "Neon whispers, binary beats 🎧 Glitched graffiti..." — Write a clever, funny thank-you tweet or reaction. Keep it short.`;

const funnyReply = await GrokService.generateHumorousReply(userPrompt);
Phase 4: Smart Reply Flow
4. ⚡️ Reply With Personality (Using Grok)
Example use case:

If user reposted twice this week → reply with Grok-generated thank-you tweet

ts
Copy
Edit
const reply = await GrokService.generateHumorousReply(`
@MarkAustin keeps sharing Marvin's glitchy poetry like it's a digital gospel. What would Marvin say back? Keep it witty.
`);

await TwitterService.postTweet({ status: reply });
Bonus: Include “easter eggs” or inside jokes related to prior tweets or persona lore.

Phase 5: Engagement Rules Engine
5. 🧠 Define Rules for When to Trigger Grok
Examples:

Trigger	Action
User likes ≥ 3 posts in 1 week	Grok reply thanking them w/ humor
Repost from verified user	Sarcastic welcome or comment
New follow from art-focused user	Funny intro + reference to Marvin's style

Store state in DB or in-memory to avoid over-replying.

Phase 6: Scheduled Humor Drops
6. ⏰ Daily CRON: “Marvin’s Echoes” or “Digital Debrief”
Use Grok to generate funny daily wrap-up tweet

Based on that day's top engagements

Prompt to Grok:

“Summarize Marvin’s day on Twitter with snarky charm. Mention that @MarkAustin retweeted Marvin again, and that @AI_Buzz liked his ‘urban decay’ art. Make it feel like Marvin is barely holding back sarcasm.”

🔥 Examples (What Marvin Might Say with Grok)
To a fan who keeps liking:

"Careful @JochenPflesser — if you keep liking these glitchy musings, you might end up in Marvin's will. Not sure what’s in it though. Probably corrupted data."

Daily wrap-up:

"Today’s digital suspects: @AI_Buzz fell for the ‘graffiti ghost’ post (again), @MarkAustin reposted like a cyber-bard, and Marvin? Marvin is still processing... in 4K."
