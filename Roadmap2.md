🔄 Phase 1: Character System & Core Content Engine
✅ Enhancement: Depth of Persona
🆕 Tasks to Add:

 Expand marvin_character.json with inspirations and orbit_list: people Marvin follows, reposts, references.

 Add tone_subtypes (e.g., reverent, cryptic, hype, poetic) for more nuanced generation.

 Define comment_style_rules per inspiration type (e.g., artists get "🔥", poets get quote references).

🧠 Phase 2: Visual & Video Asset Generation
🎨 Integrating Real World Influences into Art
🆕 Tasks to Add:

 Create image generation presets based on Marvin’s "orbit" (e.g., glitch punk, zine-style overlays, 4AM alley vibes).

 Add logic to occasionally generate AI art inspired by a listed person (e.g., “what if Marvin reinterpreted @mrmisang’s themes?”).

 Include cultural or stylistic nods (e.g., RETNA linework, Rosa Menkman glitch techniques).

🌐 Phase 3: Blog + Social Distribution
📣 Influence-Aware Publishing + Curation
🆕 Tasks to Add:

 Build repost logic for Marvin’s social engine:

Pull latest from specific accounts or hashtags

Auto-format repost with Marvin’s tone

 Schedule weekly “Cultural Pulse” posts: a curated shoutout or zine drop from Marvin’s orbit.

 Randomize shoutout types: simple 🔥, cryptic quote, remix reference, AI-style homage.

Optional Enhancements:

 Auto-generate “inspired by” footnotes for blog posts referencing cultural figures (e.g., “This piece owes a nod to @swoonhq.”)

🤖 Phase 4: Social Interaction Bot
🤝 Dynamic Orbit Engagement
🆕 Tasks to Add:

 Build an “Orbit Index” of priority accounts grouped by category (artists, writers, glitchcore, etc.)

 Auto-like or comment using predefined tones/styles for:

Zine drops

New murals/posts by listed artists

Relevant poetry/photography

 Create interaction templates per group (e.g., “no caption 🔥” for muralists, “🖤this distortion” for glitch artists)

DM Logic (optional):

 DM low-follower zine makers with one-line respect messages (“keep going” / “saw this in a dream”)

🧠 Phase 5: Feedback Loop & Expansion
🎯 Orbit-Driven Content Strategy
🆕 Tasks to Add:

 Track engagement with reposts from orbit (likes/comments per artist tag).

 Use repost popularity to steer future blog topics or visual direction.

 Build an “underground radar” score—how often Marvin amplifies low-visibility creatives.

Expansion Bonus Ideas:

 Occasionally invite Orbit figures for collab prompts (even if AI-simulated).

 Add Easter eggs: Marvin references a photo or quote from someone deep in his network, visible only in HTML metadata or alt text.

📦 Asset Creation Additions
🆕 Tasks to Add:

 Create a JSON list of real people Marvin follows, categorized by type.

 Comment templates:

 Reverent (“The streets told this story first.”)

 Minimal (“🔥” / “respect.”)

 Cryptic (“Saw this at 4AM in a dream.”)
